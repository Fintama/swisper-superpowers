/**
 * render-gate — compare a built screen against its approved mock, mechanically.
 *
 * Replaces "put them side by side and reconcile every difference", which is an
 * eyeball instruction and therefore the first thing to go at 4am.
 *
 *   node render-gate.mjs --snippet            # print the fingerprint function
 *   node render-gate.mjs mock.json built.json # diff two fingerprints  (exit 1 = findings)
 *
 * TWO HALVES ON PURPOSE. Capturing a fingerprint needs a browser and every
 * environment drives one differently (Playwright, a devtools MCP, the console).
 * Diffing is pure logic and is where the judgement lives — so the diff ships as
 * code and the capture ships as a snippet you run however you can.
 *
 * PROVEN AGAINST PLANTED DEFECTS, 2026-08-28: three deliberate deviations — a
 * font-weight change, a dropped element, an altered label — all three caught,
 * and ten unchanged elements correctly left alone. A gate that flags everything
 * is switched off within a week, so the silence matters as much as the noise.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
 *   · pixel comparison — different data, viewport and fonts make it permanently
 *     red, and a permanently red gate is a disabled gate.
 *   · "behaves the same" in general — not checkable. Name the two or three
 *     interactions that carry the design intent and assert those separately.
